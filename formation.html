                <h1>Water & Gravity</h1>
                <p>The forces of erosion combine in different ways to create natural rock arches and bridges. 
                Rock layers that remains behind in arches and bridges have survived erosion longer than the material that was once around it.
                The rock that is no longer there fell or was washed or dissolved away. 
                How the rock was formed, through tectonic pressure and movement, determines how it is affected by water and gravity.
                The rock's varying hardness and exposure to the elements means that it is not all affected the same way or at the same rate.

                <p>Along cliff-lined coasts, the constant battering force of waves erodes the rock. 
                Sand carried in the water wears away the rock even more. 
                On top of that, rock can also be dissolved by chemical reactions. 
                Where rocks vary in hardness and  composition, some parts are eaten away or worn away more quickly than others. 
                The softer parts of the rock disappear earlier than the harder parts.
                When the harder parts happen to have the form of an arch.</p>

                <p>A river running through rock carried loose rock and sand along, and scrapes out its bed. 
                When the river forms a loop, or meander, it scours out both sides of the rock in the middle of the loop. 
                The wall in the middle of the loop gets thinner and thinner. 
                Finally the river cuts through the rock wall and flows under that rock bridge, following its new, shorter path. 
                The river keeps on wearing down the rock, making the hole bigger and deeper. 
                Eventually the bridge can completely fall down.</p>

                <p>Rock beneath Earth's surface forms the roof of an underground limestone cavern or tunnel. 
                The underground space continues to be worn away by groundwater or the chemicals in it eating away the limestone. 
                Gradually, the roof becomes too thin and too weak to support itself against gravity. 
                It can crack, and parts of it collapse, leaving behind a standing arch.</p>

                <p>Wind can carry grains of rock away once they have been eroded. 
                Wind-blown sand can scour rock arches and weather them. 
                However, wind is not a cause of arch formation.</p>-->
